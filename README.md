# Java Assignment - Programmer Analyst

### Problem Statement
 
 ```
 Create a java program to implement a queue. The program should take input from console on the type of operation as shown below
  * 1 for Enqueue and 2 for  Dequeue. 
      * if user inputs 1 on console, the program should ask for an input to enqueue and add the value to the queue.
      * if user inputs 2 on console, the program should dequeue from the queue(in First in first out fashion) and print the dequeue value on console.
 
  Additional the following error conditions need to be considered
  * If the queue is full, and an enqueue operation is requested, the program should output to console the following error message - 
     Sorry. Currently the queue is full. Please try again later when atleast one dequeue is performed.
  * If the queue is empty, and a dequeue operation is requested, the program should output to console the following error message - 
     Sorry. Currently the queue is empty. Please try again later when atleast one enqueue is performed.
     
 ```
 ### Assumptions that can be made
 
 > Use an Array of ints of size 10 (you can use a bigger size if preferred) to represent your queue. No Database/Persistence is required
 
 ### What the solution should look like
 
 > A working program uploaded to github(or any public git based repo) with a README file showing us how to run the program and any additional comments/assumptions that have been made in the solution provided by you.
 
 > Working solution needs to have the following
 > * Needs to run without any errors
 > * Good Unit Tests
 > * Proper Comments
 > * Proper Exception/Error Handling Scenarios.
 
 #### Tips
 
 * A Queue is a linear structure which follows a particular order in which the operations are performed. The order is First In First Out (FIFO).
 
 
```
Good Luck
